                        Additionally, traveling has been a core component of my life since
                        I was a very young. There is no doubt that a person gets more life experience
                        by walking a mile than reading an entire book. Itâ€™s a feeling of freedom.
                        It is very lucky of me that I have chances to visit many beautiful countries around the world.
